( Message to Leonet: Here is a game I made with my friend a long time ago: https://github.com/BalintAts/CatBoxRun/tree/main )

Features I currently working on:
- Serialize the best neuaral net to a JSON file, which later can be read by the application.
- Two ways to start the application: train / run the best network.

This application teaches a car, to running trough the course.
